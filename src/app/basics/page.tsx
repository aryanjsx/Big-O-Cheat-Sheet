            Big O describes how the work an algorithm does grows as the input size <code>n</code> grows. It ignores constants
            and lower-order terms, so it tells you which algorithm wins on large inputs, not which one is faster on ten items.
            Change <code>n</code> below to see how the growth classes pull apart.
